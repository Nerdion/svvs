          With a humble start in the year 1984 when the foundation of the school was laid, to this present day, the school has got established as a reputable institution. The school is conducted by Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh Rajasthani Jain Vidya Prasarak Trust, Pune under the motivation of Acharya Shree Vijay Samudra Sureeshwarji Maharaj.<br>
          In order to achieve our maxim "Faith in Knowledge", the management provided all the necessary facilities which enabled to achieve the goal of providing values to the students which helps them becoming a responsible citizen.<br>
          Today, I can proudly say that the students of the school have got hold of (reached) great horizon of success. This was possible only with the blessings of our Guru Acharya Shree Vijay Samudra Sureeshwarji Maharaj. I thank God for showering his blessings and the strength on me to bring the school to the present heights. This would have been impossible without the competent Principals and knowledgeable Staff of the school.<br>
          May we, as a team devotedly strive hard to achieve our dream and, realize our responsibility of building a better society.
